# PRIMARY KEYS types

- _SERIAL_: Works as SEQUENCE, you can rewrite it

```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS users_serial (
	id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
	name VARCHAR
);
```

- _IDENTITY_: Similar to SERIAL, but, allows other types, also, prevents manually insertion INTEGER GENERATED ALWAYS AS IDENTITY PRIMARY KEY

```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS users_identity_default (
	id INTEGER GENERATED BY DEFAULT AS IDENTITY PRIMARY KEY, --Similar to Serial, you can insert it manually
	name VARCHAR
);
--
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS users_identity_always (
	id INTEGER GENERATED ALWAYS AS IDENTITY PRIMARY KEY, --You can not insert it manually
	name VARCHAR
);
--
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS users_identity_config (
	id INTEGER GENERATED ALWAYS AS IDENTITY (START 100 INCREMENT BY 3) PRIMARY KEY, --You can not insert it manually and sets the start and increments
	name VARCHAR
);
```

You can set a primary key combinating two fields, is not neccessary that both fields are unique, just the combination of them

```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS combined_ids (
	id int4,
	name VARCHAR,
    PRIMARY KEY (id, name)
);
```
