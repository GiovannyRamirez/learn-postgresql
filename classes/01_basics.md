# What is a database?

Is a stored, organized and structured collection of information into a db management system.

## Types

- **_Relational_**: Looks like an excel file, with columns.
- **_No relational_ (NoSQL)**: Are objects called documents grouped into a collection (like a _JSON_).

## Relational

There a are some options to work with relational databases:

- MySQL
- PostgreSQL
- Oracle Server
- Microsoft SQL Server
- etc.

Each one has pros and cons against other, but, all of them are similar with:

- Syntax: SQL
- Predefined schemas
- Focus: _Integrity_ and _Consistency_ of information

## NoSQL

There some options also:

- Firebase
- Redis
- MongoDB
- Cassandra
- Redis
- etc.

Each one has pros and cons against other, their main principles are:

- Collections and documents storage
- No predefined schemas
- Performance: _Horizontal scalability_ (more nodes instead of software enhancement), _Disponibility_, _Speed_
- Failure tolerance: (_Null_ values)

Migrate between SQL/NoSQL is difficult considering specially predefined schemas.
