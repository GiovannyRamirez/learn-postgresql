# Possible Queries

Considering the example, we can imagine possible queries like:

- Quantity of posts by user
- Quantity of comments by user
- Quantity of lists by user
- Posts more clapped
- Posts more commented
- Average of claps by user
- etc

With this, we can decide if for example, refering to lists, limit quantity by an user and offer paid features about that, or give gifts to users with many posts, etc.

And, this possible queries also allows to us, to generate indexes to improve performance of same queries.

Data is more important, so, the database design is also important to take decisions.
