# Medium Clone

Medium is a website where you can find articles from users that posts it, you can clap _(like)_ the articles, save to your profile _(in case you have an account)_.

To make a clone from [Medium](https://medium.com/), first we need to define some entities _(tables)_ like:

- _users_: Here we need

  - _user_id_: Integer, with autoincrement and, it will be primary key
  - _username_: Varchar, always need a value, so its not null
  - _name_: Varchar, always need a value, so its not null
  - _role_: Varchar, also, it can not be null
  - _gender_: Varchar, also not null
  - _avatar_: Varchar, it can be null
  - _created_at_: Its a date, so, we can define it as simple date or timestamp, in this case, it will be autogenerated, so default will be now
  - _updated_at_: Same as created_at

- _posts_: Here we need

  - _post_id_: Integer, with autoincrement and, it will be primary key
  - _title_: Varchar, always need a value, so its not null, by default is ''
  - _body_: Text, same constraints than title
  - _og_image_: Varchar, it will be an image url, but, it can be null
  - _slug_: Varchar, it will be an id for SEO, so, its not null
  - _published_: Boolean
  - _created_at_: Its a date, so, we can define it as simple date or timestamp, in this case, it will be autogenerated, so default will be now
  - _updated_at_: Same as created_at

  Now, the relation here, is, that one user can publish many posts, so, its a relation 1 to Many, and, this field will be _created_by_

  - _created_by_: Foreign key from users

- _claps_: It works as likes, (Other users claps my post) Here we need

  - _clap_id_: Integer, with autoincrement and, it will be primary key
  - _created_at_: Its a date, so, we can define it as simple date or timestamp, in this case, it will be autogenerated, so default will be now

  Now, the relations here, is, a post can have one or many claps, so, we need post_id, and, that clap have the user_id, so, the fields will be

  - _post_id_: Foreign key from posts
  - _user_id_: Foreign key from users

  Also, an user can clap multiple times, so, we need a counter

  - _counter_: Integer with default 0

- _comments_: Here we need

  - _comment_id_: Integer, with autoincrement and, it will be primary key
  - _content_: Text
  - _created_at_: Its a date, so, we can define it as simple date or timestamp, in this case, it will be autogenerated, so default will be now
  - _visible_: Boolean, it can works when an user wants to delete a comment

  The relations here, is, a post is owner of a comment, this post can have many comments, and that comment is a owner of the comment, and, an user can have many comments, so

  - _post_id_: Foreign key from posts
  - _user_id_: Foreign key from users

  Now, in Medium, the comments can replies, so, we can solve this adding a relation with a parent

  - _comment_parent_id_: Integer, here is an autorelation
